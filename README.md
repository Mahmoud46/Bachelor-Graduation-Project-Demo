# Nexira – Hospital Administration Decision Support System

Nexira is a comprehensive **hospital management and decision-support platform** designed to assist healthcare administrators in improving operational efficiency, reducing patient waiting times, and enhancing overall service quality. Developed as a **graduation project** at the **Department of Systems and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University**, Nexira applies engineering, analytical, and simulation techniques to real-world healthcare challenges.

The system transforms hospital operational data into **actionable insights** using statistical analysis, discrete-event simulations, and performance evaluation tools, enabling administrators to make **data-driven decisions** that optimize hospital operations.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Healthcare institutions face increasing pressure to improve patient care while efficiently managing resources. Nexira addresses this by providing administrators with tools to:

- Monitor hospital performance indicators
- Analyze patient flow and resource utilization
- Simulate operational changes before implementation
- Compare hospital performance and benchmark against best practices

The platform acts as a **decision-support layer**, reducing uncertainty and enabling strategic, evidence-based planning.
